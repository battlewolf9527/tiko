```

#### Remarks

Use the **SendKeys** method to send keystrokes to applications that have no automation interface. Most keyboard characters are represented by a single keystroke. Some keyboard characters are made up of combinations of keystrokes (CTRL+SHIFT+HOME, for example). To send a single keyboard character, send the character itself as the string argument. For example, to send the letter x, send the string argument "x".

**Note**: To send a space, send the string " ".

You can use **SendKeys** to send more than one keystroke at a time. To do this, create a compound string argument that represents a sequence of keystrokes by appending each keystroke in the sequence to the one before it. For example, to send the keystrokes a, b, and c, you would send the string argument "abc". The **SendKeys** method uses some characters as modifiers of characters (instead of using their face-values). This set of special characters consists of parentheses, brackets, braces, and the:

•	plus sign      "+",
•	caret          "^",
•	percent sign "%",
•	and tilde      "~"

Send these characters by enclosing them within braces "{}". For example, to send the plus sign, send the string argument "{+}". Brackets "[ ]" have no special meaning when used with **SendKeys**, but you must enclose them within braces to accommodate applications that do give them a special meaning (for dynamic data exchange (DDE) for example).

•	To send bracket characters, send the string argument "{[}" for the left bracket and "{]}" for the right one.
•	To send brace characters, send the string argument "{{}" for the left brace and "{}}" for the right one.

Some keystrokes do not generate characters (such as ENTER and TAB). Some keystrokes represent actions (such as BACKSPACE and BREAK). To send these kinds of keystrokes, send the arguments shown in the following table:

| Key  | Argument |
| ---- | -------- |
| BACKSPACE | {BACKSPACE}, {BS}, or {BKSP} |
| BREAK | {BREAK} |
| CAPS LOCK | {CAPSLOCK} |
| DEL or DELETE | {DELETE} or {DEL} |
| DOWN ARROW | {DOWN} |
| END | {END} |
| ENTER | {ENTER} or ~ |
| ESC | {ESC} |
| HELP | {HELP} |
| HOME | {HOME} |
| INS or INSERT | {INSERT} or {INS} |
| LEFT ARROW | {LEFT} |
| NUM LOCK | {NUMLOCK} |
| PAGE DOWN | {PGDN} |
| PAGE UP | {PGUP} |
| PRINT SCREEN | {PRTSC} |
| RIGHT ARROW | {RIGHT} |
| SCROLL LOCK | {SCROLLLOCK} |
| TAB | {TAB} |
| UP ARROW | {UP} |
| F1 | {F1} |
| F2 | {F2} |
| F3 | {F3} |
| F4 | {F4} |
| F5 | {F5} |
| F6 | {F6} |
| F7 | {F7} |
| F8 | {F8} |
| F9 | {F9} |
| F10 | {F10} |
| F11 | {F11} |
| F12 | {F12} |
| F13 | {F13} |
| F14 | {F14} |
| F15 | {F15} |
| F16 | {F16} |

To send keyboard characters that are comprised of a regular keystroke in combination with a SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT, create a compound string argument that represents the keystroke combination. You do this by preceding the regular keystroke with one or more of the following special characters:

| Key  | Special Character |
| ---- | -------- |
| SHIFT | + |
| CTRL | ^ |
| ALT | % |

**Note**: When used this way, these special characters are not enclosed within a set of braces.

To specify that a combination of SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT should be held down while several other keys are pressed, create a compound string argument with the modified keystrokes enclosed in parentheses. For example, to send the keystroke combination that specifies that the SHIFT key is held down while:

•	e and c are pressed, send the string argument "+(ec)".
•	e is pressed, followed by a lone c (with no SHIFT), send the string argument "+ec".
 

You can use the SendKeys method to send a pattern of keystrokes that consists of a single keystroke pressed several times in a row. To do this, create a compound string argument that specifies the keystroke you want to repeat, followed by the number of times you want it repeated. You do this using a compound string argument of the form {keystroke number}. For example, to send the letter "x" ten times, you would send the string argument "{x 10}". Be sure to include a space between keystroke and number.

**Note**: The only keystroke pattern you can send is the kind that is comprised of a single keystroke pressed several times. For example, you can send "x" ten times, but you cannot do the same for "Ctrl+x".

**Note**: You cannot send the PRINT SCREEN key {PRTSC} to an application.

## Constructor

Creates an instance of the `CWhsExec` class.

Runs an application in a child command-shell, providing access to the StdIn/StdOut/StdErr streams.

```
CONSTRUCTOR CWhsExec (BYREF wszCommand AS WSTRING)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszCommand* | The command to execute. |

#### Usage example:

```
#include "AfxNova/AfxWsh.inc"
#include "AfxNova/CTextStream.inc"
USING AfxNova
DIM pWshExec AS CWhsExec = "%comspec% /c dir"
IF pWshExec THEN
   DIM pStdOutStm AS CTextStream = pWshExec.GetStdOut
   IF pStdOutStm THEN
      IF pStdOutStm.EOS = FALSE THEN
         ' // The console uses the CP_OEMCP code page
         DIM dwsOut AS DWSTRING
         dwsOut.OEM = pStdOutStm.ReadAll
         ' // You can also use
         ' DIM dwsOut AS DWSTRING = DWSTRING(pStdOutStm.ReadAll, CP_OEMCP)
         print dwsOut
      END IF
   END IF
END IF
```
---

## CAST

Returns a pointer to the **IWshExec** interface.

```
OPERATOR CAST () AS Afx_IWshExec PTR
```
---

## GetLastResult

Returns the result code returned by the last executed method.

```
FUNCTION GetLastResult () AS HRESULT
```
---

## GetErrorInfo

Returns a description of the last result code.

```
FUNCTION GetErrorInfo (BYVAL nError AS LONG = -1) AS DWSTRING
```
---

## CurrentDirectory

Retrieves or changes the current active directory.

```
[GET] PROPERTY CurrentDirectory () AS DWSTRING
[SET] PROPERTY CurrentDirectory (BYREF wszDir AS WSTRING) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszDir* | The directory to set. |

The [GET] **CurrentDirectory** returns a string that contains the fully qualified path of the current working directory of the active process.

The [SET] **CurrentDirectory** sets the current working directory of the active process.

---

## GetStatus

Provides status information about a script run with the Exec method.

```
FUNCTION GetStatus () AS WshExecStatus
```

#### Return value

The **Status** property returns a value from the *WshExecStatus* enumerated type. WshRunning = 0, WshFinished = 1, WshFailed = 2.

---

## GetStdIn

Exposes the stdin input stream of the **IWshExec** interface.

```
FUNCTION GetStdIn () AS Afx_ITextStream PTR
```

#### Return value

A pointer to the **ITextStream** interface.

---

## GetStdOut

Exposes the stdin output stream of the **IWshExec** interface.

```
FUNCTION GetStdOut () AS Afx_ITextStream PTR
```

#### Return value

A pointer to the **ITextStream** interface.

---

## GetStdErr

Provides access to the stderr output stream of the **IWshExec** interface.

```
FUNCTION GetStdErr () AS Afx_ITextStream PTR
```

#### Return value

A pointer to the **ITextStream** interface.

---

## GetExitCode

Returns the exit code set by a script or program run using the **Exec** method (called by the constructor).

```
FUNCTION GetExitCode () AS LONG
```

#### Remarks

Executables set an exit code when they finish running. This conveys the status information when a process ends. Often, it is used to send an error code (or some other piece of information) back to the caller. If the process has not finished, the **GetExitCode** property returns 0. The values returned from ^^GetExitCode** depend on the application that was called.

---

## GetProcessID

Returns the process ID (PID) for a process started with the **Exec** method (called by the constructor).

```
FUNCTION GetProcessID () AS LONG
```

#### Remarks

You can use the **GetProcessID** property to activate an application (as an argument to the **AppActivate** method).

---

## AppActivate

Activates an application window.

```
FUNCTION AppActivate (BYREF wszTitle AS WSTRING, BYVAL bWait AS BOOLEAN = FALSE) AS BOOLEAN
```
```
FUNCTION AppActivate (BYREF processID AS LONG, BYVAL bWait AS BOOLEAN = FALSE) AS BOOLEAN
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszTitle* | Specifies which application to activate. This can be a string containing the title of the application (as it appears in the title bar) or the application's Process ID. |
| *processID* | Specifies which application to activate. This can be a string containing the title of the application (as it appears in the title bar) or the application's Process ID. |
| *bWait* | Boolean. TRUE or FALSE. |

#### Remarks

The **AppActivate** method returns a Boolean value that identifies whether the procedure call is successful. This method changes the focus to the named application or window, but it does not affect whether it is maximized or minimized. Focus moves from the activated application window when the user takes action to change the focus (or closes the window).

In determining which application to activate, the specified title is compared to the title string of each running application. If no exact match exists, any application whose title string begins with title is activated. If an application still cannot be found, any application whose title string ends with title is activated. If more than one instance of the application named by title exists, one instance is arbitrarily activated.

---

## Terminate

Instructs the script engine to end the process started by the **Exec** method (called by the constructor).

```
FUNCTION Terminate
```

#### Remarks

The **Terminate** method does not return a value. Use the **Terminate** method only as a last resort since some applications do not clean up properly. As a general rule, let the process run its course and end on its own. The **Terminate** method attempts to end a process using the **WM_CLOSE** message. If that does not work, it kills the process immediately without going through the normal shutdown procedure.

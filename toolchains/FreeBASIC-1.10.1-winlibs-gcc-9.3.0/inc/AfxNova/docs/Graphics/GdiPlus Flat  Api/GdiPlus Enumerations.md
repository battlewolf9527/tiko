Color channel values greater than 240 are set to 255. |
| *AdjustBlackSaturation* | 7 | When you set the adjustment member of a **ColorCurveParams** object to **AdjustBlackSaturation**, you should set the **adjustValue** member to an integer in the range 0 through 255. A value of t specifies that the interval [t, 255] is mapped linearly to the interval [0, 255]. For example, if **adjustValue** is equal to 15, then color channel values in the interval [15, 255] are adjusted so that they spread out over the interval [0, 255]. Color channel values less than 15 are set to 0. |

To apply one of the eight adjustments to a bitmap, follow these steps.

1. Create a *ColorCurveParams* structure, and set its adjustment member to one of the elements of the **CurveAdjustments** enumeration.
2. Set the other two members (adjustValue and channel) of the **ColorCurveParams** structure.
3. Pass the address of the **ColorCurveParams** structure to the **GdipSetEffectParameters** function.
4. Call the **GdipBitmapApplyEffect** function.

---

## CurveChannel

The **CurveChannel** enumeration specifies which color channels are affected by a **ColorCurve** bitmap adjustment.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *CurveChannelAll* | 0 | Specifies that the color adjustment applies to all channels. |
| *CurveChannelRed* | 1 | Specifies that the color adjustment applies only to the red channel. |
| *CurveChannelGreen* | 2 | Specifies that the color adjustment applies only to the green channel. |
| *CurveChannelBlue* | 2 | Specifies that the color adjustment applies only to the blue channel. |

---

## CustomLineCapType

Specifies the type of custom line cap. You would typically use this value when creating a new **AdjustableArrowCap** object or when setting a custom line cap for a **Pen** object in GDI+

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *CustomLineCapTypeDefault* | 0 | Default custom line cap. |
| *CustomLineCapTypeAdjustableArrow* | 1 | Indicates that the line cap being defined is an adjustable arrow. |

---

## DashCap

Specifies the type of graphic shape to use on both ends of each dash in a dashed line.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *DashCapFlat* | 0 | Specifies a square cap that squares off both ends of each dash. |
| *DashCapRound* | 2 | Specifies a circular cap that rounds off both ends of each dash. |
| *DashCapTriangle* | 3 | Specifies a triangular cap that points both ends of each dash. |

---

## DashStyle

The **DashStyle** enumeration specifies the line style of a line drawn with a Windows GDI+ pen. The line can be drawn by using one of several predefined styles or a custom style.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *DashStyleSolid* | 0 | Specifies a solid line. |
| *DashStyleDash* | 1 | Specifies a dashed line. |
| *DashStyleDot* | 2 | Specifies a dotted line. |
| *DashStyleDashDot* | 3 | Specifies an alternating dash-dot line. |
| *DashStyleDashDotDot* | 4 | Specifies an alternating dash-dot-dot line. |
| *DashStyleCustom* | 5 | Specifies a user-defined, custom dashed line. |

#### Remarks

A custom dashed line is created by calling the **GdipSetPenDashArray** function, which takes an array of values for the dash lengths and the space lengths.

## DitherType

Identifies the available algorithms for dithering when a bitmap is converted.

Calling the **GdipBitmapConvertFormat** function of a **Bitmap** object changes the pixel format of that **Bitmap**. If the conversion results in a reduced bit depth (fewer bits per pixel), then certain colors in the original bitmap will be simulated by a dither (checkerboard) pattern made up of colors that are available in the new pixel format. The members of the **DitherType** enumeration identify the algorithms available for performing this dithering.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *DitherTypeNone* | 0 | No dithering is performed. Pixels in the source bitmap are mapped to the nearest color in the palette specified by the palette parameter of the **GdipBitmapConvertFormat** function. This algorithm can be used with any palette. If the palette specified by the palette parameter does not have one of the standard fixed formats listed in the PaletteType enumeration, pass PaletteTypeCustom to the palettetype parameter. |
| *DitherTypeSolid* | 1 | No dithering is performed. Pixels in the source bitmap are mapped to the nearest color in the palette specified by the palette parameter of the **GdipBitmapConvertFormat** function. This algorithm can be used with any palette. If the palette specified by the palette parameter does not have one of the standard fixed formats listed in the PaletteType enumeration, pass *PaletteTypeCustom* to the palettetype parameter. |
| *DitherTypeOrdered4x4* | 2 | You can use this algorithm to perform dithering based on the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. You can also use this algorithm to convert a bitmap to a 16-bits-per-pixel format that has no palette. |
| *DitherTypeOrdered8x8* | 3 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeOrdered16x16* | 4 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeSpiral4x4* | 5 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeSpiral8x8* | 6 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeDualSpiral4x4* | 7 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeDualSpiral8x8* | 8 | Dithering is performed using the colors in one of the standard fixed palettes. |
| *DitherTypeErrorDiffusion* | 9 | Dithering is performed based on the palette specified by the palette parameter of the **GdipBitmapConvertFormat** function. This algorithm can be used with any palette. If the palette specified by the palette parameter does not have one of the standard fixed formats listed in the **PaletteType** enumeration, pass *PaletteTypeCustom* to the palettetype parameter. |
| *DitherTypeMax* | 10 |  |

---

## DriverStringOptions

The **DriverStringOptions** enumeration specifies the spacing, orientation, and quality of the rendering for driver strings.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *DriverStringOptionsCmapLookup* | 1 | Specifies that the string array contains Unicode character values. If this flag is not set, each value in array is interpreted as an index to a font glyph that defines a character to be displayed. |
| *DriverStringOptionsVertical* | 2 | Specifies that the string is displayed vertically. |
| *DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance* | 4 | Specifies that the glyph positions are calculated from the position of the first glyph. If this flag is not set, the glyph positions are obtained from an array of coordinates. |
| *DriverStringOptionsLimitSubpixel* | 8 | Specifies that less memory should be used for cache of antialiased glyphs. This also produces lower quality. If this flag isn't set, more memory is used, but the quality is higher. |

---

## EmfPlusRecordType

The **EmfPlusRecordType** enumeration identifies metafile record types used in Windows Metafile Format (WMF), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), and EMF+ files. The elements of the **EmfPlusRecordType** enumeration come in three groups.

* Elements in the first group have the prefix WmfRecordType and identity WMF records.
* Elements in the second group have the prefix EmfRecordType and identify EMF records.
* Elements in the third group have the prefix EmfPlusRecordType and identify EMF+ records.

WMF and EMF records can be displayed by Windows GDI+ and by Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI). EMF+ records can be displayed by GDI+ but not by GDI.

Elements that have the WmfRecordType prefix are analogous to constants (defined in Wingdi.h) that have the prefix META_. For example, the element **WmfRecordTypeSetBkColor** is analogous to the constant META_SETBKCOLOR. For more information about WMF files, see Windows-Format Metafiles.

Elements that have the EmfRecordType prefix are analogous to constants (defined in Wingdi.h) that have the prefix EMR_. For example, the element EmfRecordTypePolygon is analogous to the constant EMR_POLYGON. For more information about EMR constants, see EMR.

Elements that have the EmfPlusRecordType prefix are specific to GDI+. Most of those elements correspond to methods of the Graphics class. The remaining elements identify the header, the end of the file, and other sections of the metafile. The Constants section of this topic shows the correspondence between the EMF+ record types and the methods of the Graphics class.

## EmfToWmfBitsFlags

Specifies options for the **GdipEmfToWmfBits** function, which converts an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) metafile to a Windows Metafile Format (WMF) metafile.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *EmfToWmfBitsFlagsDefault* | &H00000000 | Specifies the default conversion. |
| *EmfToWmfBitsFlagsEmbedEmf* | &H00000001 | Specifies that the source EMF metafile is embedded as a comment in the resulting WMF metafile. |
| *EmfToWmfBitsFlagsIncludePlaceable* | &H00000002 | Specifies that the resulting WMF metafile is in the placeable metafile format; that is, it has the additional 22-byte header required by a placeable metafile. |
| *EmfToWmfBitsFlagsNoXORClip* | &H00000004 | Specifies that the clipping region is stored in the metafile in the traditional way.

| *StringDigitSubstituteTraditional* | 3 | Specifies substitution digits that correspond with the user's native script or language, which may be different from the official national language of the user's locale. |

---

## StringFormatFlags

The **StringFormatFlags** enumeration specifies text layout information (such as orientation and clipping) and display manipulations (such as ellipsis insertion, digit substitution, and representation of characters that are not supported by a font).

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft* | &h00000001 | Specifies that reading order is right to left. For horizontal text, characters are read from right to left. For vertical text, columns are read from right to left. By default, horizontal or vertical text is read from left to right. |
| *StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical* | &h00000002 | Specifies that individual lines of text are drawn vertically on the display device. By default, lines of text are horizontal, each new line below the previous line. |
| *StringFormatFlagsNoFitBlackBox* | &h00000004 | Specifies that parts of characters are allowed to overhang the string's layout rectangle. By default, characters are first aligned inside the rectangle's boundaries, then any characters which still overhang the boundaries are repositioned to avoid any overhang and thereby avoid affecting pixels outside the layout rectangle. An italic, lowercase letter F (f) is an example of a character that may have overhanging parts. Setting this flag ensures that the character aligns visually with the lines above and below but may cause parts of characters, which lie outside the layout rectangle, to be clipped or painted. |
| *StringFormatFlagsDisplayFormatControl* | &h00000020 | Specifies that Unicode layout control characters are displayed with a representative character. |
| *StringFormatFlagsNoFontFallback* | &h00000400 | Specifies that an alternate font is used for characters that are not supported in the requested font. By default, any missing characters are displayed with the "fonts missing" character, usually an open square. |
| *StringFormatFlagsMeasureTrailingSpaces* | &h00000800 | Specifies that the space at the end of each line is included in a string measurement. By default, the boundary rectangle returned by the **GdipMeasureString** method excludes the space at the end of each line. Set this flag to include that space in the measurement. |
| *StringFormatFlagsNoWrap* | &h00001000 | Specifies that the wrapping of text to the next line is disabled. NoWrap is implied when a point of origin is used instead of a layout rectangle. When drawing text within a rectangle, by default, text is broken at the last word boundary that is inside the rectangle's boundary and wrapped to the next line. |
| *StringFormatFlagsLineLimit* | &h00002000 | Specifies that only entire lines are laid out in the layout rectangle. By default, layout continues until the end of the text or until no more lines are visible as a result of clipping, whichever comes first. The default settings allow the last line to be partially obscured by a layout rectangle that is not a whole multiple of the line height. To ensure that only whole lines are seen, set this flag and be careful to provide a layout rectangle at least as tall as the height of one line. |
| *StringFormatFlagsNoClip* | &h00004000 | Specifies that characters overhanging the layout rectangle and text extending outside the layout rectangle are allowed to show. By default, all overhanging characters and text that extends outside the layout rectangle are clipped. Any trailing spaces (spaces that are at the end of a line) that extend outside the layout rectangle are clipped. Therefore, the setting of this flag will have an effect on a string measurement if trailing spaces are being included in the measurement. If clipping is enabled, trailing spaces that extend outside the layout rectangle are not included in the measurement. If clipping is disabled, all trailing spaces are included in the measurement, regardless of whether they are outside the layout rectangle. |
| *StringFormatFlagsBypassGDI* | &h80000000 |  |

#### Remarks

Multiple flags set can produce combined effects:

* When both **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** are set, individual lines of text are drawn vertically. The first line starts at the right edge of the layout rectangle; the second line of text is to the left of the first line, and so on.
* When **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** is set and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** is not set, individual lines of text are drawn vertically. The first line starts at the left edge of the layout rectangle; the second line of text is to the right of the first line.
* When **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** is set and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** is not set, the individual lines of text are horizontal and the reading order is from right to left. This setting does not change the order in which characters are displayed, it simply specifies the order in which characters can be read.

The **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** flags can affect string alignment.

---

## StringTrimming

The **StringTrimming** enumeration specifies how to trim characters from a string so that the string fits into a layout rectangle. The layout rectangle is used to position and size the display string.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *StringTrimmingNone* | 0 | Specifies that no trimming is done. |
| *StringTrimmingCharacter* | 1 | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last character that is inside the layout rectangle. This is the default. |
| *StringTrimmingWord* | 2 | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last word that is inside the layout rectangle. |
| *StringTrimmingEllipsisCharacter* | 3 | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last character that is inside the layout rectangle and an ellipsis (...) is inserted after the character. |
| *StringTrimmingEllipsisWord* | 4 | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last word that is inside the layout rectangle and an ellipsis (...) is inserted after the word. |
| *StringTrimmingEllipsisPath* | 5 | Specifies that the center is removed from the string and replaced by an ellipsis. The algorithm keeps as much of the last portion of the string as possible. |

#### Remarks

Trimming affects only the last visible or partly visible (due to clipping) line of text.

---

## TestControlEnum

Used for internal testing of GDI+. Specifies changes in image-processing behavior.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |

| *TestControlGetBuildNumber* | 2 | Gets the GDI+ build number. |

---

## TextRenderingHint

The **TextRenderingHint** enumeration specifies the process used to render text. The process affects the quality of the text.

| Name  | Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| *TextRenderingHintSystemDefault* | 0 | Specifies that a character is drawn using the currently selected system font smoothing mode (also called a rendering hint). |
| *TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixelGridFit* | 1 | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph bitmap and hinting to improve character appearance on stems and curvature. |
| *TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixel* | 2 | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph bitmap and no hinting. This results in better performance at the expense of quality. |
| *TextRenderingHintAntiAliasGridFit* | 3 | Specifies that a character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap and hinting. This results in much better quality due to antialiasing at a higher performance cost. |
| *TextRenderingHintAntiAlias* | 4 | Specifies that a character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap and no hinting. Stem width differences may be noticeable because hinting is turned off. |
| *TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit* | 5 | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph ClearType bitmap and hinting. This type of text rendering cannot be used along with **CompositingModeSourceCopy**. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Windows only: ClearType rendering is supported only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Windows. Therefore, **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit** is ignored on other operating systems even though GDI+ is supported on those operating systems. |

#### Remarks

The quality associated with each process varies according to the circumstances. **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit** provides the best quality for most LCD monitors and relatively small font sizes. **TextRenderingHintAntiAlias** provides the best quality for rotated text. Generally, a process that produces higher quality text is slower than a process that produces lower quality text.
